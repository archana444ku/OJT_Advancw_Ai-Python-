                    Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and uses learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] Such machines may be called AIs

                    Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it an excellent language for beginners and experienced developers. Getting Started with Python is easy due to its straightforward syntax and extensive documentation, which provides ample resources for learning and development.

                Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do
